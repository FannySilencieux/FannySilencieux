- 👋 Hi, I’m @FannySilencieux
- 👀 I’m interested in everything as long as it's interesting ^^
- 🌱 I’m currently learning life. And trust me, it's not easy!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on everyday improvements. If you can help, please let me know. I won't be able to improve by myself.
- ⚡ Fun fact: If something can be broken, I will break it, trust me. That makes me the best QA engineer and the worst person for the IT. Sorry guys, I swear I didn't mean to break it.
